The manuscript demonstrates that a relatively small amount of training data (700 images out of a dataset of 2600) can be used to automate the remaining full dataset analysis with similar accuracy to slow, semi-automated approaches, and better accuracy than automated approaches. }

This is a timely article, and one which correctly characterises key issues facing those creating and using image analysis tools in the biological sciences. The data presented is interesting and informative, and biologists using image analysis tools should be made aware of the issues raised in this paper.\\

\textbf{F1000 Recommended:} FLOR-ID presents an impressive effort in bringing together literature on flowering-time regulation in Arabidopsis. Pathways are presented as interconnected schemes with the possibility of accessing individual gene information such as mutant phenotype or post-translational regulation. Every scheme presents data in a very explicit way, making this database ideal for newcomers to the field or for teaching.\\
