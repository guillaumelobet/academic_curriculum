\textbf{F1000 Recommended:} FLOR-ID presents an impressive effort in bringing together literature on flowering-time regulation in Arabidopsis. Pathways are presented as interconnected schemes with the possibility of accessing individual gene information such as mutant phenotype or post-translational regulation. Every scheme presents data in a very explicit way, making this database ideal for newcomers to the field or for teaching.\\
